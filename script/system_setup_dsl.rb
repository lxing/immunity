# This is small goal-oriented DSL for installing system components, similar in purpose to Chef and Puppet.
# It's inspired by Babushka (http://github.com/benhoskings/babushka) but is simpler and is tailored for
# provisioning a production webapp.
#
# Usage:
#
# require "system_setup_dsl"
# include SystemSetupDsl
# dep "my library" do
#   met? { (check if your dependency is met) }
#   meet { (install your dependency) }
# end
#
# TODO(philc): Gemify this.
